# Security

## Understand what you collect

For each piece of user-tied data, document:

- **Purpose** — What it’s collected for (specific list).
- **Retention** — When it will be deleted; how users can delete it (not only internal teams).
- **Collection** — How it’s gathered.

Collect only at the minimum granularity needed. Keep this in internal docs; consider a user-facing summary (e.g. privacy policy).

## Prevent overreach

- Don’t use data for undeclared purposes; don’t gather “just in case.”
- Require a short, named justification for access to user data.
- Enforce deletion as defined in retention docs.
- When saying “no” to a new use of data, offer alternatives so privacy is part of the product, not a blocker.
